# Titanic-ML_prediction

Problem definition:
If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve. In this case, we are trying to predict the survivability of a person in the Titanic disaster based on a few features. What model or algorithm we are going to use? That's a concern at the later stage of the pipeline.
We will use the popular scikit-learn library to develop our machine learning algorithms. In sklearn, algorithms are called Estimators and implemented in their own classes. For data visualization, we will use the matplotlib and seaborn library.
